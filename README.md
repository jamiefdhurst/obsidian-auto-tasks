# Automatic Tasks for Obsidian

Combine periodic notes with tags and tasks to automatically manage your daily, weekly and project TODO lists.

Designed to work with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), requires the [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) and [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugins. The [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugin is optional.
